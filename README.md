# practice-data-sets
easy access practice stats files

This is my easy-access datasets projects for a Python class. I put it here mainly so students can easily access it through Google Colab, since sometimes the datasets are all over the place.

Notes about individual datasets:

The Pokemon file should include all 898 Pokemon as of July 6th, 2021. Original file from Alberto Barradas.
The Forest Fires Data Set is from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Forest+Fires.
